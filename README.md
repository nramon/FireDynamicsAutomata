# Wildland Fire Spread Dynamics Simulator

This is an implementation of a probabilistic cellular automata model for wildland fire spread dynamics based on the work of Almeida and Macau (2001).

## Running the simulator

The simulator is written in JavaScript and runs locally on your browser. To start it click [here](https://nramon.github.io/FireDynamicsAutomata/).

Click on the vegetation cells (green) in the canvas to start fires. Then click on *Step* to run a single simulation step, or click on *Run* to run a continuous simulation (until you click on *Stop*).

Use the sliders to change the simulation parameters.
